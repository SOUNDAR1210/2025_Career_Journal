# My Career based Learning Journey for 2025

This repository documents my year-long journey learning for upscaling in my Career and interests in computer science. I'm tracking my progress, solutions, and insights gained along the way.

## Goals

- Master the computer science fundamentals in-depth about operating system, internals of databases and containerization technologies.
- Learn more backend concepts and get dirty at doing meaningful projects in spring framework with scaling technologies like kafka, redis,
 cloud and AI.
- Learn and implement algorithms for advance problem-solving concepts and real life cases in a more intuitive way.
- Attend competitive program contests from platforms like CodeForces,Atcoder,LeetCode.
- Develop a intuition for building a system with more efficient and scalable features with system design concepts.
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews.
- Improve my problem-solving skills and code efficiency.

## Learning Structure

I've organized this journey by months, with weekly progress tracking and monthly reviews.

## Progress Metrics

I'll track my progress using:
- Monthly completion of learning goals
- Number of projects completed
- Competitive programming rating improvements
- System design case studies completed
- Technical interview practice sessions
